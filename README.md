# Leonardo Salles’ Interactive Portfolio

**Leonardo Salles’ Personal Portfolio** is an **interactive front-end web project** showcasing the developer’s skills, experience, and selected works. Built with **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript (ES6+)**, **Bootstrap**, and **responsive design principles**, it features accessible navigation, animated content, and a project carousel.

The portfolio presents multiple projects, including interactive games and API-powered applications, with detailed descriptions, live previews, and links to GitHub repositories. **Animations** and **hover effects** enhance the **user experience**, while **semantic HTML** and **ARIA attributes** ensure **accessibility** across devices.

This project was developed as the **final capstone** for the **“Web Design for Everybody” specialization** offered by the **University of Michigan**, emphasizing responsive design, accessibility, dynamic UI, and front-end best practices.
